# BERT Question Answering Inference/Fine-Tuning with Mixed Precision

## 1. Overview

Bidirectional Embedding Representations from Transformers (BERT), is a method of pre-training language representations which obtains state-of-the-art results on a wide array of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

The original paper can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805.

NVIDIA's BERT 19.10 is an optimized version of Google's official implementation, leveraging mixed precision arithmetic and tensor cores on V100 GPUS for faster training times while maintaining target accuracy.

### 1.a Learning objectives

This repository contains multiple notebooks which demonstrate:
- Inference on QA task with BERT Large model
- The use/download of pretrained NVIDIA BERT models
- Fine-Tuning on SQuaD 2.0 Dataset
- Use of Mixed Precision for Inference and Fine-Tuning

Here is a short description of each relevant file:
 - _bert_squad_tf_inference.ipynb_ : BERT Q&A Inference with TF Checkpoint model
 - _bert_squad_tf_finetuning.ipynb_ : BERT Fine-Tuning on SQuaD dataset

## 2. Quick Start Guide

### 2.a Build the BERT TensorFlow NGC container:
To run the notebook you first need to build the Bert TensorFlow container using the following command from the main directory of this repository:

``` bash
docker build . --rm -t bert
```
### 2.b Dataset

We need to download the vocabulary and the bert_config files:

``` python3
python3 /workspace/bert/data/bertPrep.py --action download --dataset google_pretrained_weights  # Includes vocab
```

This is only needed during fine-tuning in order to download the Squad dataset:

``` python3
python3 /workspace/bert/data/bertPrep.py --action download --dataset squad
```

### 2.c Start of the NGC container to run inference:
Once the image is built, you need to run the container with the `--publish
0.0.0.0:8888:8888` option to publish Jupyter's port `8888` to the host machine
at port `8888` over all network interfaces (`0.0.0.0`):

```bash
nvidia-docker run \
  -v $PWD:/workspace/bert \
  -v $PWD/results:/results \
  --shm-size=1g \
  --ulimit memlock=-1 \
  --ulimit stack=67108864 \
  --publish 0.0.0.0:8888:8888 \
  -it bert:latest bash
```

Then you can use the following command within the BERT Tensorflow container under
`/workspace/bert`:

```bash
jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --allow-root
```

And navigate a web browser to the IP address or hostname of the host machine
at port `8888`:

```
http://[host machine]:8888
```

Use the token listed in the output from running the `jupyter` command to log
in, for example:

```
http://[host machine]:8888/?token=aae96ae9387cd28151868fee318c3b3581a2d794f3b25c6b
```
