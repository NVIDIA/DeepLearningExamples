## Models

The following table provides links to where you can find additional information on each model:

| **Model** | **Link**|
|-----------|---------|
| resnet50 | [README](./resnet50v1.5/README.md) |
| resnext101-32x4d | [README](./resnext101-32x4d/README.md) |
| se-resnext101-32x4d | [README](./se-resnext101-32x4d/README.md) |

## Validation accuracy results

Our results were obtained by running the applicable training scripts in the tensorflow-20.06-tf1-py3 NGC container 
on NVIDIA DGX-1 with (8x V100 16G) GPUs. The specific training script that was run is documented in the corresponding model's README.

The following table shows the validation accuracy results of the 
three classification models side-by-side.


| **arch** | **AMP Top1** | **AMP Top5** | **FP32 Top1** | **FP32 Top5** |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| resnet50            | 78.35 | 94.21 | 78.34 | 94.21 |
| resnext101-32x4d    | 80.21 | 95.00 | 80.21 | 94.99 |
| se-resnext101-32x4d | 80.87 | 95.35 | 80.84 | 95.37 |

## Training performance results

### Training performance: NVIDIA DGX A100 (8x A100 40G)

Our results were obtained by running the applicable 
training scripts in the tensorflow-20.06-tf1-py3 NGC container 
on NVIDIA DGX A100 with (8x A100 40G) GPUs. 
Performance numbers (in images per second) 
were averaged over an entire training epoch.
The specific training script that was run is documented 
in the corresponding model's README.

The following table shows the training accuracy results of the 
three classification models side-by-side.


| **arch** | **Mixed Precision XLA** | **TF32 XLA** | **Mixed Precision speedup** |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| resnet50            | 16400 img/s | 6300 img/s | 2.60x |
