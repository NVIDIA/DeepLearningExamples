## Model overview

This UNet model is adapted from the original version of the [UNet model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) which is
a convolutional auto-encoder for 2D image segmentation. UNet was first introduced by
Olaf Ronneberger, Philip Fischer, and Thomas Brox in the paper:
[UNet: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597).

This work proposes a modified version of UNet, called `TinyUNet` which performs efficiently and with very high accuracy
on the industrial anomaly dataset [DAGM2007](https://resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/conference/dagm/2007/prizes.html).
*TinyUNet*, like the original *UNet* is composed of two parts:
- an encoding sub-network (left-side)
- a decoding sub-network (right-side).

It repeatedly applies 3 downsampling blocks composed of two 2D convolutions followed by a 2D max pooling
layer in the encoding sub-network. In the decoding sub-network, 3 upsampling blocks are composed of a upsample2D
layer followed by a 2D convolution, a concatenation operation with the residual connection and two 2D convolutions.

`TinyUNet` has been introduced to reduce the model capacity which was leading to a high degree of over-fitting on a
small dataset like DAGM2007. The complete architecture is presented in the figure below:

### Feature support matrix
 
The following features are supported by this model.
 
| **Feature** | **UNet Medical** |
|---------------------------------|-----|
| Automatic mixed precision (AMP) | Yes |
| Horovod Multi-GPU (NCCL)        | Yes |
| Accelerated Linear Algebra (XLA)| Yes |
 
#### Features
 
**Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP)**
 
This implementation of UNet uses AMP to implement mixed precision training. It allows us to use FP16 training with FP32 master weights by modifying just a few lines of code.
 
**Horovod**
 
Horovod is a distributed training framework for TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and MXNet. The goal of Horovod is to make distributed deep learning fast and easy to use. For more information about how to get started with Horovod, see the [Horovod: Official repository](https://github.com/horovod/horovod).
 
**Multi-GPU training with Horovod**
 
Our model uses Horovod to implement efficient multi-GPU training with NCCL. For details, see example sources in this repository or see the [TensorFlow tutorial](https://github.com/horovod/horovod/#usage).
 
**XLA support (experimental)**
 
XLA is a domain-specific compiler for linear algebra that can accelerate TensorFlow models with potentially no source code changes. The results are improvements in speed and memory usage: most internal benchmarks run ~1.1-1.5x faster after XLA is enabled.
 
### Mixed precision training
 
Mixed precision is the combined use of different numerical precisions in a computational method. [Mixed precision](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03740) training offers significant computational speedup by performing operations in half-precision format while storing minimal information in single-precision to retain as much information as possible in critical parts of the network. Since the introduction of [Tensor Cores](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensor-cores) in Volta, and following with both the Turing and Ampere architectures, significant training speedups are experienced by switching to mixed precision -- up to 3x overall speedup on the most arithmetically intense model architectures. Using [mixed precision training](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/mixed-precision-training/index.html) previously required two steps:
1.  Porting the model to use the FP16 data type where appropriate.    
2.  Adding loss scaling to preserve small gradient values.

This can now be achieved using Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) for TensorFlow to enable the full [mixed precision methodology](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/mixed-precision-training/index.html#tensorflow) in your existing TensorFlow model code.  AMP enables mixed precision training on Volta and Turing GPUs automatically. The TensorFlow framework code makes all necessary model changes internally.

In TF-AMP, the computational graph is optimized to use as few casts as necessary and maximize the use of FP16, and the loss scaling is automatically applied inside of supported optimizers. AMP can be configured to work with the existing tf.contrib loss scaling manager by disabling the AMP scaling with a single environment variable to perform only the automatic mixed-precision optimization. It accomplishes this by automatically rewriting all computation graphs with the necessary operations to enable mixed precision training and automatic loss scaling.

-   How to train using mixed precision, see the [Mixed Precision Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03740) paper and [Training With Mixed Precision](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/mixed-precision-training/index.html) documentation.
-   Techniques used for mixed precision training, see the [Mixed-Precision Training of Deep Neural Networks](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/mixed-precision-training-deep-neural-networks/) blog.
-   How to access and enable AMP for TensorFlow, see [Using TF-AMP](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/dgx/tensorflow-user-guide/index.html#tfamp) from the TensorFlow User Guide.

#### Enabling mixed precision
 
This implementation exploits the TensorFlow Automatic Mixed Precision feature. In order to enable mixed precision training, the following environment variables must be defined with the correct value before the training starts:
```
TF_ENABLE_AUTO_MIXED_PRECISION=1
```
Exporting these variables ensures that loss scaling is performed correctly and automatically.
By supplying the `--amp` flag to the `main.py` script while training in FP32, the following variables are set to their correct value for mixed precision training:
```
if params.use_amp:
  os.environ['TF_ENABLE_AUTO_MIXED_PRECISION'] = '1'
```
 
#### Enabling TF32

TensorFloat-32 (TF32) is the new math mode in [NVIDIA A100](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/) GPUs for handling the matrix math also called tensor operations. TF32 running on Tensor Cores in A100 GPUs can provide up to 10x speedups compared to single-precision floating-point math (FP32) on Volta GPUs. 

TF32 Tensor Cores can speed up networks using FP32, typically with no loss of accuracy. It is more robust than FP16 for models which require high dynamic range for weights or activations.

For more information, refer to the [TensorFloat-32 in the A100 GPU Accelerates AI Training, HPC up to 20x](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/) blog post.

TF32 is supported in the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture and is enabled by default.

## Quick Start Guide
 
To train your model using mixed precision with Tensor Cores or using FP32, perform the following steps using the default parameters of the UNet model on the [EM segmentation challenge dataset](http://brainiac2.mit.edu/isbi_challenge/home). These steps enable you to build the UNet TensorFlow NGC container, train and evaluate your model, and generate predictions on the test data. Furthermore, you can then choose to:
* compare your evaluation accuracy with our [Training accuracy results](#training-accuracy-results),
* compare your training performance with our [Training performance benchmark](#training-performance-benchmark),
* compare your inference performance with our [Inference performance benchmark](#inference-performance-benchmark).
 
For the specifics concerning training and inference, see the [Advanced](#advanced) section.

1. Clone the repository.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples
    cd DeepLearningExamples/TensorFlow/Segmentation/UNet_Industrial
    ```

2. Build the UNet TensorFlow NGC container.

    ```bash
    # Build the docker container
    docker build . --rm -t unet_industrial:latest
    ```
3. Start an interactive session in the NGC container to run preprocessing/training/inference.

    ```bash
    # make a directory for the dataset, for example ./dataset
    mkdir <path/to/dataset/directory>
    # make a directory for results, for example ./results
    mkdir <path/to/results/directory>
    # start the container with nvidia-docker
    nvidia-docker run -it --rm --gpus all \
        --shm-size=2g --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 \
        -v <path/to/dataset/directory>:/data/ \
        -v <path/to/result/directory>:/results \
        unet_industrial:latest
    ```

4. Download and preprocess the dataset: DAGM2007

    In order to download the dataset. You can execute the following:
   
    ```bash
    ./download_and_preprocess_dagm2007.sh /data
    ```

    **Important Information:** Some files of the dataset require an account to be downloaded, the script will invite you to download them manually and put them in the correct directory.

5. Start training.

To run training for a default configuration (as described in Default configuration, for example 1/4/8 GPUs,
FP32/TF-AMP), launch one of the scripts in the `./scripts` directory called
`./scripts/UNet{_AMP}_{1, 4, 8}GPU.sh`

Each of the scripts requires three parameters:
* path to the results directory of the model as the first argument
* path to the dataset as a second argument
* class ID from DAGM used (between 1-10)

For example, for class 1:

```bash
cd scripts/
./UNet_1GPU.sh /results /data 1
```

6. Run evaluation

Model evaluation on a checkpoint can be launched by running  one of the scripts in the `./scripts` directory
called `./scripts/UNet{_AMP}_EVAL.sh`.

Each of the scripts requires three parameters:
* path to the results directory of the model as the first argument
* path to the dataset as a second argument
* class ID from DAGM used (between 1-10)

For example, for class 1:

```bash
cd scripts/
./UNet_EVAL.sh /results /data 1
```

#### Dataset guidelines

The UNet model was trained with the [Weakly Supervised Learning for Industrial Optical Inspection (DAGM 2007)](https://resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/conference/dagm/2007/prizes.html) dataset.

> The competition is inspired by problems from industrial image processing. In order to satisfy their customers' needs, companies have to guarantee the quality of their products, which can often be achieved only by inspection of the finished product. Automatic visual defect detection has the potential to reduce the cost of quality assurance significantly.
>
> The competitors have to design a stand-alone algorithm which is able to detect miscellaneous defects on various background textures.
>
> The particular challenge of this contest is that the algorithm must learn, without human intervention, to discern defects automatically from a weakly labeled (i.e., labels are not exact to the pixel level) training set, the exact characteristics of which are unknown at development time. During the competition, the programs have to be trained on new data without any human guidance.

**Source:** https://resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/conference/dagm/2007/prizes.html

> The provided data is artificially generated, but similar to real world problems. It consists of multiple data sets, each consisting of 1000 images showing the background texture without defects, and of 150 images with one labeled defect each on the background texture. The images in a single data set are very similar, but each data set is generated by a different texture model and defect model.

> Not all deviations from the texture are necessarily defects. The algorithm will need to use the weak labels provided during the training phase to learn the properties that characterize a defect.

> Below are two sample images from two data sets. In both examples, the left images are without defects; the right ones contain a scratch-shaped defect which appears as a thin dark line, and a diffuse darker area, respectively. The defects are weakly labeled by a surrounding ellipse, shown in red.

![DAGM_Examples](images/dagm2007.png)

The DAGM2007 challenge comes in propose two different challenges:
- A development set: public and available for download from
[here](https://resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/conference/dagm/2007/prizes.html).
The number of classes and sub-challenges for the development set is 6.
- A competition set: which requires an account to be downloaded from [here](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/node/3616).
The number of classes and sub-challenges for the competition set is 10.

The challenge consists in designing a single model with a set of predefined hyper-parameters which will not change
across the 10 different classes or sub-challenges of the competition set.

The performance shall be measured on the competition set which is normalized and more complex that the public dataset
while offering the most unbiased evaluation method.

### Training Process

*Laplace Smoothing*

We use this technique in the DICE loss to improve the training efficiency. This technique consists in replacing the
epsilon parameter (used to avoid dividing by zero and very small: +/- 1e-7) by 1. You can find more information on:
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_smoothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_smoothing)

*Adaptive Loss*

The DICE Loss is not able to provide a meaningful gradient at initialisation. This leads to a model instability which
often push the model to diverge. Nonetheless, once the model starts to converge, DICE loss is able to very efficiently
fully train the model. Therefore, we implemented an *adaptive loss* which is composed of two sub-losses:

- Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)
- DICE Loss

The model is trained with the BCE loss until the DICE Loss reach a experimentally defined threshold (0.3).
Thereafter, DICE loss is used to finish training.

*Weak Labelling*

This dataset is referred as weakly labelled. That means that the segmentation labels are not given at the pixel level
but rather in an approximate fashion.

## Performance

### Benchmarking

The following sections shows how to run benchmarks measuring the model performance in training and inference modes.

#### Training performance benchmark

To benchmark the inference performance, you can run one of the scripts in the `./scripts/benchmarking/` directory
called `./scripts/benchmarking/UNet_trainbench{_AMP}_{1, 4, 8}GPU.sh`.

Each of the scripts requires three parameters:
* path to the dataset as the first argument
* class ID from DAGM used (between 1-10)

For example:

```bash
cd scripts/benchmarking/
./UNet_trainbench_1GPU.sh /data 1
```

#### Inference performance benchmark

To benchmark the training performance, you can run one of the scripts in the `./scripts/benchmarking/` directory
called `./scripts/benchmarking/UNet_evalbench{_AMP}.sh`.

Each of the scripts requires three parameters:
* path to the dataset as the first argument
* class ID from DAGM used (between 1-10)

For example:

```bash
cd scripts/benchmarking/
./UNet_evalbench_AMP.sh /data 1
```
