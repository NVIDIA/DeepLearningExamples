## Model overview
 
BERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is a new method of pre-training language representations which obtains state-of-the-art results on a wide array of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. This model is based on the [BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) paper. NVIDIA's implementation of BERT is an optimized version of the [Hugging Face implementation](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-pretrained-BERT), leveraging mixed precision arithmetic and Tensor Cores on Volta V100 GPUs for faster training times while maintaining target accuracy.
 
This repository contains scripts to interactively launch data download, training, benchmarking and inference routines in a Docker container for both pre-training and fine-tuning for tasks such as question answering. The major differences between the original implementation of the paper and this version of BERT are as follows:
 
-   Scripts to download Wikipedia and BookCorpus datasets
-   Scripts to preprocess downloaded data or a custom corpus into inputs and targets for pre-training in a modular fashion
-   Fused [LAMB](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.00962.pdf) optimizer to support training with larger batches
-   Fused Adam optimizer for fine tuning tasks
-   Fused CUDA kernels for better performance LayerNorm
-   Automatic mixed precision (AMP) training support
-   Scripts to launch on multiple number of nodes
 
Other publicly available implementations of BERT include:
1. [NVIDIA TensorFlow](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/TensorFlow/LanguageModeling/BERT)
2. [Hugging Face](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-pretrained-BERT)
3. [codertimo](https://github.com/codertimo/BERT-pytorch)
4. [gluon-nlp](https://github.com/dmlc/gluon-nlp/tree/master/scripts/bert)
5. [Google's implementation](https://github.com/google-research/bert)
    
This model trains with mixed precision Tensor Cores on Volta and provides a push-button solution to pretraining on a corpus of choice. As a result, researchers can get results 4x faster than training without Tensor Cores. This model is tested against each NGC monthly container release to ensure consistent accuracy and performance over time.

### Model architecture
 
The BERT model uses the same architecture as the encoder of the Transformer. Input sequences are projected into an embedding space before being fed into the encoder structure. Additionally, positional and segment encodings are added to the embeddings to preserve positional information. The encoder structure is simply a stack of Transformer blocks, which consist of a multi-head attention layer followed by successive stages of feed-forward networks and layer normalization. The multi-head attention layer accomplishes self-attention on multiple input representations.
 
An illustration of the architecture taken from the [Transformer paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf) is shown below.
 
 ![BERT](images/model.png)
 
### Default configuration
 
The architecture of the BERT model is almost identical to the Transformer model that was first introduced in the [Attention Is All You Need paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf). The main innovation of BERT lies in the pre-training step, where the model is trained on two unsupervised prediction tasks using a large text corpus. Training on these unsupervised tasks produces a generic language model, which can then be quickly fine-tuned to achieve state-of-the-art performance on language processing tasks such as question answering.
 
The BERT paper reports the results for two configurations of BERT, each corresponding to a unique model size. This implementation provides the same configurations by default, which are described in the table below.  
 
| **Model** | **Hidden layers** | **Hidden unit size** | **Attention heads** | **Feedforward filter size** | **Max sequence length** | **Parameters** |
|:---------:|:----------:|:----:|:---:|:--------:|:---:|:----:|
|BERTBASE |12 encoder| 768| 12|4 x  768|512|110M|
|BERTLARGE|24 encoder|1024| 16|4 x 1024|512|330M|

### Feature support matrix
 
The following features are supported by this model.  
 
| **Feature** | **BERT** |
|:---------:|:----------:|
|APEX AMP|Yes|
|APEX DDP|Yes|
|LAMB|Yes|
|Multi-node|Yes|
 
#### Features
 
[APEX](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex) is a PyTorch extension with NVIDIA-maintained utilities to streamline mixed precision and distributed training, whereas [AMP](https://nvidia.github.io/apex/amp.html) is an abbreviation used for automatic mixed precision training.
 
[DDP](https://nvidia.github.io/apex/parallel.html) stands for DistributedDataParallel and is used for multi-GPU training.

[LAMB](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.00962.pdf) stands for Layerwise Adaptive Moments based optimizer, is a large batch optimization technique that helps accelerate training of deep neural networks using large minibatches. It allows using a global batch size of 65536 and 32768 on sequence lengths 128 and 512 respectively, compared to a batch size of 256 for Adam. The optimized implementation accumulates 1024 gradients batches in phase 1 and 4096 steps in phase 2 before updating weights once. This results in 15% training speedup. On multi-node systems, LAMB allows scaling up to 1024 GPUs resulting in training speedups of up to 72x in comparison to [Adam](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6980.pdf). Adam has limitations on the learning rate that can be used since it is applied globally on all parameters whereas LAMB follows a layerwise learning rate strategy.

NVLAMB adds necessary tweaks to [LAMB version 1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00962v1), to ensure correct convergence. A guide to implementating the LAMB optimizer can be found in our [article](https://medium.com/@NvidiaAI/a-guide-to-optimizer-implementation-for-bert-at-scale-8338cc7f45fd) on Medium.com. The algorithm is as follows:

### Mixed precision training
 
Mixed precision is the combined use of different numerical precisions in a computational method. [Mixed precision](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03740) training offers significant computational speedup by performing operations in half-precision format, while storing minimal information in single-precision to retain as much information as possible in critical parts of the network. Since the introduction of [Tensor Cores](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensor-cores) in the Volta and Turing architecture, significant training speedups are experienced by switching to mixed precision -- up to 3x overall speedup on the most arithmetically intense model architectures. Using mixed precision training requires two steps:
 
1.  Porting the model to use the FP16 data type where appropriate.
2.  Adding loss scaling to preserve small gradient values.
 
For information about:
-   How to train using mixed precision, see the [Mixed Precision Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03740) paper and [Training With Mixed Precision](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/mixed-precision-training/index.html) documentation.
-   Techniques used for mixed precision training, see the [Mixed-Precision Training of Deep Neural Networks](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/mixed-precision-training-deep-neural-networks/) blog.
-   APEX tools for mixed precision training, see the [NVIDIA APEX: Tools for Easy Mixed-Precision Training in PyTorch](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/apex-pytorch-easy-mixed-precision-training/).

#### Enabling mixed precision
 
In this repository, mixed precision training is enabled by NVIDIA’s APEX library. The APEX library has an automatic mixed precision module that allows mixed precision to be enabled with minimal code changes.
 
Automatic mixed precision can be enabled with the following code changes:
 
```
from apex import amp
if fp16:
    # Wrap optimizer and model
    model, optimizer = amp.initialize(model, optimizer, opt_level=<opt_level>, loss_scale="dynamic")
 
if fp16:
    with amp.scale_loss(loss, optimizer) as scaled_loss:
        scaled_loss.backward()
   ```
 
Where `<opt_level>` is the optimization level. In the pretraining, `O2` is set as the optimization level. Mixed precision training can be turned on by passing the `fp16` argument to the `run_pretraining.py` and `run_squad.py`. All shell scripts have a positional argument available to enable mixed precision training.

-   Learning rate - The default is `3e-5`.
-   Precision (either `fp16` or `fp32`) - The default is `fp16`.
-   Number of GPUs - The default is `8`.
-   Seed - The default is `1`.
-   SQuAD directory -  The default is `/workspace/bert/data/v1.1`.
-   Vocabulary file (token to ID mapping) - The default is `/workspace/bert/vocab/vocab`.
-   Output directory for result - The default is `/results/SQuAD`.
-   Mode (`train`, `eval`, `train eval`, `predict`) - The default is `train`.
-   Config file for the BERT model (It should be the same as the pretrained model) - The default is `/workspace/bert/bert_config.json`.
 
The script saves the final checkpoint to the `/results/SQuAD/pytorch_model.bin` file.

#### Multi-node
 
Multi-node runs can be launched on a pyxis/enroot Slurm cluster (see [Requirements](#requirements)) with the `run.sub` script with the following command for a 4-node DGX-1 example for both phase 1 and phase 2:
 
```
BATCHSIZE=2048 LR=6e-3 GRADIENT_STEPS=128 PHASE=1 sbatch -N4 --ntasks-per-node=8 run.sub
BATCHSIZE=1024 LR=4e-3 GRADIENT_STEPS=256 PHASE=2 sbatch -N4 --ntasks-per-node=8 run.sub
```
 
Checkpoint after phase 1 will be saved in `checkpointdir` specified in `run.sub`. The checkpoint will be automatically picked up to resume training on phase 2. Note that phase 2 should be run after phase 1.
 
Variables to re-run the [Training performance results](#training-performance-results) are available in the `configurations.yml` file. 
 
The batch variables `BATCHSIZE`, `LR`, `GRADIENT_STEPS`,`PHASE` refer to the Python arguments `train_batch_size`, `learning_rate`, `gradient_accumulation_steps`, `phase2` respectively.
 
Note that the `run.sub` script is a starting point that has to be adapted depending on the environment. In particular, variables such as `datadir` handle the location of the files for each phase. 
 
Refer to the files contents to see the full list of variables to adjust for your system.

### Getting the data
 
For pre-training BERT, we use the concatenation of Wikipedia (2500M words) as well as BookCorpus (800M words). For Wikipedia, we extract only the text passages and ignore headers, lists, and tables. BERT requires that datasets are structured as a document level corpus rather than a shuffled sentence level corpus because it is critical to extract long contiguous sentences.
 
The preparation of the pre-training dataset is described in the `bertPrep.py` script found in the `data/` folder. The component steps in the automated scripts to prepare the datasets are as follows:
 
1.  Data download and extract - the dataset is downloaded and extracted.
 
2.  Clean and format - document tags, etc. are removed from the dataset.
 
3.  Sentence segmentation - the corpus text file is processed into separate sentences.
 
4.  Sharding - the sentence segmented corpus file is split into a number of uniformly distributed smaller text documents.
 
5.  `hdf5` file creation - each text file shard is processed by the `create_pretraining_data.py` script to produce a corresponding `hdf5` file. The script generates input data and labels for masked language modeling and sentence prediction tasks for the input text shard.
 
The tools used for preparing the BookCorpus and Wikipedia datasets can be applied to prepare an arbitrary corpus. The `create_datasets_from_start.sh` script in the `data/` directory applies sentence segmentation, sharding, and `hdf5` file creation given an arbitrary text file containing a document-separated text corpus.
 
For fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model for specific tasks, by default this repository prepares the following dataset:
 
-   [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/): for question answering
 
Depending on the speed of your internet connection, this process takes about a day to complete. The BookCorpus server could sometimes get overloaded and also contain broken links resulting in HTTP 403 and 503 errors. You can either skip the missing files or retry downloading at a later time.

#### Dataset guidelines
 
The procedure to prepare a text corpus for pre-training is described in the above section. This section will provide additional insight into how exactly raw text is processed so that it is ready for pre-training.
 
First, raw text is tokenized using [WordPiece tokenization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.08144.pdf). A [CLS] token is inserted at the start of every sequence, and the two sentences in the sequence are separated by a [SEP] token.
 
Note: BERT pre-training looks at pairs of sentences at a time. A sentence embedding token [A] is added to the first sentence and token [B] to the next.
 
BERT pre-training optimizes for two unsupervised classification tasks. The first is Masked Language Modelling (Masked LM). One training instance of Masked LM is a single modified sentence. Each token in the sentence has a 15% chance of being replaced by a [MASK] token. The chosen token is replaced with [MASK] 80% of the time, 10% with a random token and the remaining 10% the token is retained. The task is then to predict the original token.
 
The second task is next sentence prediction. One training instance of BERT pre-training is two sentences (a sentence pair). A sentence pair may be constructed by simply taking two adjacent sentences from a single document, or by pairing up two random sentences with equal probability. The goal of this task is to predict whether or not the second sentence followed the first in the original document.
 
The `create_pretraining_data.py` script takes in raw text and creates training instances for both pre-training tasks.

#### Multi-dataset
 
This repository provides functionality to combine multiple datasets into a single dataset for pre-training on a diverse text corpus at the shard level in `data/create_datasets_from_start.sh`.

### Training process
 
The training process consists of two steps: pre-training and fine-tuning.

#### Pre-training
 
Pre-training is performed using the `run_pretraining.py` script along with parameters defined in the `scripts/run_pretraining.sh`.
 
The `run_pretraining.sh` script runs a job on a single node that trains the BERT-large model from scratch using Wikipedia and BookCorpus datasets as training data using the LAMB optimizer. By default, the training script runs two phases of training with a hyperparameter recipe specific to 8x V100 32G cards:
 
Phase 1: (Maximum sequence length of 128)
-   Runs on 8 GPUs with training batch size of 64 per GPU
-   Uses a learning rate of 6e-3
-   Has FP16 precision enabled
-   Runs for 7038 steps, where the first 28.43% (2000) are warm-up steps
-   Saves a checkpoint every 200 iterations (keeps only the latest 3 checkpoints) and at the end of training. All checkpoints, and training logs are saved to the `/results` directory (in the container which can be mounted to a local directory).
-   Creates a log file containing all the output

Phase 2: (Maximum sequence length of 512)
-   Runs on 8 GPUs with training batch size of 8 per GPU
-   Uses a learning rate of 4e-3
-   Has FP16 precision enabled
-   Runs for 1563 steps, where the first 12.8% are warm-up steps
-   Saves a checkpoint every 200 iterations (keeps only the latest 3 checkpoints) and at the end of training. All checkpoints, and training logs are saved to the `/results` directory (in the container which can be mounted to a local directory).
-   Creates a log file containing all the output

These parameters will train on Wikipedia and BookCorpus to state-of-the-art accuracy on a DGX-1 with 32GB V100 cards.
 
`bash run_pretraining.sh <training_batch_size> <learning-rate> <precision> <num_gpus> <warmup_proportion> <training_steps> <save_checkpoint_steps> <resume_training> <create_logfile> <accumulate_gradients> <gradient_accumulation_steps> <seed> <job_name> <allreduce_post_accumulation> <allreduce_post_accumulation_fp16> <accumulate_into_fp16> <train_bath_size_phase2> <learning_rate_phase2> <warmup_proportion_phase2> <train_steps_phase2> <gradient_accumulation_steps_phase2> `
 
Where:
 
-   `<training_batch_size>` is per-GPU batch size used for training. Larger batch sizes run more efficiently, but require more memory.
-   `<learning_rate>` is the base learning rate for training
-   `<precision>` is the type of math in your model, can be either `fp32` or `fp16`. The options mean:
    -   FP32: 32-bit IEEE single precision floats.
    -   FP16: Mixed precision 16 and 32-bit floats.
-   `<num_gpus>` is the number of GPUs to use for training. Must be equal to or smaller than the number of GPUs attached to your node.
-   `<warmup_proportion>` is the percentage of training steps used for warm-up at the start of training.
-   `<training_steps>` is the total number of training steps.
-   `<save_checkpoint_steps>` controls how often checkpoints are saved.
-   `<resume_training>` if set to `true`, training should resume from the latest model in `/results/checkpoints`. Default is `false`.
-   `<create_logfile>` a flag indicating if output should be written to a log file or not (acceptable values are `true` or 'false`. `true` indicates output should be saved to a log file.)
-   `<accumulate_gradient>` a flag indicating whether a larger batch should be simulated with gradient accumulation.
-   `<gradient_accumulation_steps>` an integer indicating the number of steps to accumulate gradients over. Effective batch size = `training_batch_size` / `gradient_accumulation_steps`.
-   `<seed>` random seed for the run.
- `<allreduce_post_accumulation>` - If set to `true`, performs `allreduce` only after the defined number of gradient accumulation steps.
- `<allreduce_post_accumulation_fp16>` -  If set to `true`, performs `allreduce` after gradient accumulation steps in FP16.
 
    Note: The above two options need to be set to false when running on FP32. 
    
-  `<training_batch_size_phase2>` is per-GPU batch size used for training in phase 2. Larger batch sizes run more efficiently, but require more memory.
-   `<learning_rate_phase2>` is the base learning rate for training phase 2.
-   `<warmup_proportion_phase2>` is the percentage of training steps used for warm-up at the start of training.
-   `<training_steps_phase2>` is the total number of training steps for phase 2, to be continued in addition to phase 1.
-   `<gradient_accumulation_steps_phase2>` an integer indicating the number of steps to accumulate gradients over in phase 2. Effective batch size = `training_batch_size_phase2` / `gradient_accumulation_steps_phase2`.
-   `<init_checkpoint>` A checkpoint to start the pretraining routine on (Usually a BERT pretrained checkpoint).
 
For example:
 
`bash scripts/run_pretraining.sh`

Trains BERT-large from scratch on a DGX-1 32G using FP16 arithmetic. 90% of the training steps are done with sequence length 128 (phase 1 of training) and 10% of the training steps are done with sequence length 512 (phase 2 of training).
 
To train on a DGX-1 16G, set `gradient_accumulation_steps` to `512` and `gradient_accumulation_steps_phase2` to `1024` in `scripts/run_pretraining.sh`.
 
To train on a DGX-2 32G, set `train_batch_size` to `4096`, `train_batch_size_phase2` to `2048`, `num_gpus` to `16`, `gradient_accumulation_steps` to `64` and `gradient_accumulation_steps_phase2` to `256` in `scripts/run_pretraining.sh`
 
In order to run pre-training routine on an initial checkpoint, do the following in `scripts/run_pretraining.sh`:
-   point the `init_checkpoint` variable to location of the checkpoint
-   set `resume_training` to `true`
-   Note: The parameter value assigned to `BERT_CONFIG` during training should remain unchanged. Also to resume pretraining on your corpus of choice, the training dataset should be created using the same vocabulary file used in `data/create_datasets_from_start.sh`.

#### Fine-tuning
 
Fine-tuning is provided for a variety of tasks. The following tasks are included with this repository through the following scripts:
 
-   Question Answering (`scripts/run_squad.sh`)

By default, each Python script implements fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model for a specified number of training epochs as well as evaluation of the fine-tuned model. Each shell script invokes the associated Python script with the following default parameters:
 
-   Uses 8 GPUs
-   Has FP16 precision enabled
-   Saves a checkpoint at the end of training to the `/results/<dataset_name>` folder

Fine-tuning Python scripts implement support for mixed precision and multi-GPU training through NVIDIA’s [APEX](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex) library. For a full list of parameters and associated explanations, see the [Parameters](#parameters) section.
 
All fine-tuning shell scripts have the same positional arguments, outlined below:
 
```bash scripts/run_squad.sh <checkpoint_to_load> <epochs> <batch_size per GPU> <learning rate> <precision (either `fp16` or `fp32`)> <number of GPUs to use> <seed> <SQuAD_DATA_DIR> <VOCAB_FILE> <OUTPUT_DIR> <mode (either `train`, `eval` or `train eval`)> <CONFIG_FILE>```
 
By default, the mode positional argument is set to train eval. See the [Quick Start Guide](#quick-start-guide) for explanations of each positional argument.
 
Note: The first positional argument (the path to the checkpoint to load) is required.
 
Each fine-tuning script assumes that the corresponding dataset files exist in the `data/` directory or separate path can be a command-line input to `run_squad.sh`.


### Inference process
 
#### Pre-training inference
 
Inference on a pretrained model is performed using the `run_pretraining_inference.py` script along with parameters defined in `scripts/run_pretraining_inference.sh`. Inference is supported both for single and multi-GPU. By setting either the `--eval` or `--prediction` flag, you can choose between running evaluation on a given dataset or doing prediction (on both masked language model and next sentence prediction).
 
Prediction mode can be used to measure the inference turnaround time.
 
The `run_pretraining_inference.sh` script takes a model and a dataset and performs inference/evaluation on it. By default, the inferencing script:
 
-   Has FP16 precision enabled
-   Runs on 8 GPUs
-   Evaluates the latest checkpoint present in `/results/checkpoints` with a batch size of 14
-   Runs inference on the entire Wikipedia dataset

This script outputs a prediction file to `/results/pyt_bert_pretraining_inference_<precision>_<global_batchsize>.<datestamp>.log`. The output log contains information about:
 
-   Inference performance
-   Loss (masked language model loss and next sentence prediction loss) of the specified dataset if ground truths exist with the `--eval` flag.

For example:
 
`bash scripts/run_pretraining_inference.sh <evaluation_batch_size> <precision> <num_gpus> <inference_mode><model_checkpoint><inference_steps><create_logfile>`
 
Where:
 
-   `<evaluation_batch_size>` is per-GPU batch size used for inference. Larger batch sizes run more efficiently, but require more memory.
-   `<precision>` is the type of math in your model, can be either `fp32` or `fp16`. The options mean:
    -   `fp32`: 32-bit IEEE single precision floats
    -   `fp16`: 16-bit floats for 3.2x faster inference
-   `<num_gpus>` is the number of GPUs to use for inference. Must be equal to or smaller than the number of GPUs attached to your node.
-   `<inference_mode>` is either `--eval` for evaluation or `--prediction` for inference
-   `<model_checkpoint>` is the model checkpoint to run inference on. Default is `-1`, which takes the most recent model checkpoint from the `checkpoints` folder.
-   `<inference_steps>` is the total number of inference steps per process. Default is `-1`, which iterates over the entire dataset.
-   `<create_logfile>` a flag indicating if output should be written to a logfile or not (acceptable values are `true` or `false`. `true` indicates output should be saved to a logfile.)

For example:
 
`bash scripts/run_pretraining_inference.sh 14 fp16 8 eval -1 -1 true`

#### Fine-tuning inference
 
Evaluation fine-tuning is enabled by the same scripts as training:
 
-   Question Answering (`scripts/run_squad.sh`)

The mode positional argument of the shell script is used to run in evaluation mode. The fine-tuned BERT model will be run on the evaluation dataset, and the evaluation loss and accuracy will be displayed.
 
Each inference shell script expects dataset files to exist in the same locations as the corresponding training scripts. The inference scripts can be run with default settings. By setting the `mode` variable in the script to either `eval` or `prediction` flag, you can choose between running predictions and evaluating them on a given dataset or just the former.
 
`bash scripts/run_squad.sh <path to fine-tuned model checkpoint>`
 
### Deploying BERT using NVIDIA Triton Inference Server
 
The [NVIDIA Triton Inference Server](https://github.com/NVIDIA/triton-inference-server) provides a cloud inferencing solution optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. The server provides an inference service via an HTTP or GRPC endpoint, allowing remote clients to request inferencing for any model being managed by the server. More information on how to perform inference using NVIDIA Triton Inference Server can be found in [triton/README.md](./triton/README.md).
