## Model overview

The NCF model focuses on providing recommendations, also known as collaborative filtering with implicit feedback. The training data for this model should contain binary information about whether a user interacted with a specific item.
NCF was first described by Xiangnan He, Lizi Liao, Hanwang Zhang, Liqiang Nie, Xia Hu and Tat-Seng Chua in the [Neural Collaborative Filtering paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05031).

The implementation in this repository focuses on the NeuMF instantiation of the NCF architecture.
We modified it to use dropout in the FullyConnected layers. This reduces overfitting and increases the final accuracy.
Training the other two instantiations of NCF (GMF and MLP) is not supported.

Contrary to the original paper, we benchmark the model on the larger [ML-20m dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/)
instead of using the smaller [ML-1m](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/) dataset as we think this is more realistic of production type environments.
However, using the ML-1m dataset is also supported.

This model is trained with mixed precision using Tensor Cores on Volta, Turing, and the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architectures. Therefore, researchers can get results 2x faster than training without Tensor Cores, while experiencing the benefits of mixed precision training.


### Model architecture

This model is based mainly on Embedding and FullyConnected layers. The control flow is divided into two branches:
* Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) branch, which transforms the input through FullyConnected layers with ReLU activations and dropout.
* Matrix Factorization (MF) branch, which performs collaborative filtering factorization.
Each user and each item has two embedding vectors associated with it -- one for the MLP branch and the other for the MF branch.

The outputs from those branches are concatenated and fed to the final FullyConnected layer with sigmoid activation.
This can be interpreted as a probability of a user interacting with a given item.

### Default configuration

The following features were implemented in this model:
  * Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP)
  * Data-parallel multi-GPU training and evaluation
  * Dropout
  * Gradient accumulation

The following performance optimizations were implemented in this model:
  * FusedAdam optimizer
  * Approximate train negative sampling
  * Caching all the positive training samples in the device memory


### Feature support matrix
The following features are supported by this model:

| **Feature** | **NCF PyTorch** |
|:---:|:--------:|
| Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) | Yes |
| Multi-GPU training with Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) | Yes |
| Fused Adam | Yes |

#### Features

* Automatic Mixed Precision - This implementation of NCF uses AMP to implement mixed precision training.
It allows us to use FP16 training with FP32 master weights by modifying just 3 lines of code.
* Multi-GPU training with Distributed Data Parallel - uses Apex's DDP to implement efficient multi-GPU training with NCCL.
* Fused Adam - We use a special implementation of the Adam implementation provided by the Apex package. It fuses some operations for faster weight updates.
Since NCF is a relatively lightweight model with a large number of parameters, weâ€™ve observed significant performance improvements from using FusedAdam.

### Mixed precision training

Mixed precision is the combined use of different numerical precisions in a computational method. [Mixed precision](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03740) training offers significant computational speedup by performing operations in half-precision format, while storing minimal information in single-precision to retain as much information as possible in critical parts of the network. Since the introduction of [tensor cores](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensor-cores) in Volta, and following with both the Turing and Ampere architectures, significant training speedups are experienced by switching to mixed precision -- up to 3x overall speedup on the most arithmetically intense model architectures. Using mixed precision training requires two steps:
1.  Porting the model to use the FP16 data type where appropriate.
2.  Adding loss scaling to preserve small gradient values.

The ability to train deep learning networks with lower precision was introduced in the Pascal architecture and first supported in [CUDA 8](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/tag/fp16/) in the NVIDIA Deep Learning SDK.

#### Enabling mixed precision

Using the Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) package requires two modifications in the source code.
The first one is to initialize the model and the optimizer using the `amp.initialize` function:
```python
model, optimizer = amp.initialize(model, optimizer, opt_level="O2"
                                          keep_batchnorm_fp32=False, loss_scale='dynamic')
```

The second one is to use the AMP's loss scaling context manager:
```python
with amp.scale_loss(loss, optimizer) as scaled_loss:
    scaled_loss.backward()
```

#### Enabling TF32

TensorFloat-32 (TF32) is the new math mode in [NVIDIA A100](#https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/) GPUs for handling the matrix math also called tensor operations. TF32 running on Tensor Cores in A100 GPUs can provide up to 10x speedups compared to single-precision floating-point math (FP32) on Volta GPUs.

TF32 Tensor Cores can speed up networks using FP32, typically with no loss of accuracy. It is more robust than FP16 for models which require high dynamic range for weights or activations.

For more information, refer to the [TensorFloat-32 in the A100 GPU Accelerates AI Training, HPC up to 20x](#https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/) blog post.

TF32 is supported in the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture and is enabled by default.


## Setup
The following section lists the requirements in order to start training the Neural Collaborative Filtering model.

### Requirements
This repository contains Dockerfile which extends the PyTorch NGC container and encapsulates some dependencies. Aside from these dependencies, ensure you have the following components:

- [NVIDIA Docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)
- PyTorch 20.06-py3+ NGC container
-   Supported GPUs:
    - [NVIDIA Volta architecture](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/volta-gpu-architecture/)
    - [NVIDIA Turing architecture](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/turing/)
    - [NVIDIA Ampere architecture](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/nvidia-ampere-gpu-architecture/)


For more information about how to get started with NGC containers, see the following sections from the NVIDIA GPU Cloud Documentation and the Deep Learning Documentation:
-   [Getting Started Using NVIDIA GPU Cloud](https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/ngc-getting-started-guide/index.html)
-   [Accessing And Pulling From The NGC Container Registry](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/user-guide/index.html#accessing_registry)

Running PyTorch

For those unable to use the [framework name] NGC container, to set up the required environment or create your own container, see the versioned [NVIDIA Container Support Matrix](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/support-matrix/index.html).  

## Quick Start Guide

To train your model using mixed or TF32 precision with Tensor Cores or using FP32, perform the following steps using the default parameters of the NCF model on the ML-20m dataset. For the specifics concerning training and inference, see the [Advanced](#advanced) section.

1. Clone the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples
cd DeepLearningExamples/PyTorch/Recommendation/NCF/
```

2. Build an NCF PyTorch Docker container.

After Docker is setup, you can build the NCF image with:
```bash
docker build . -t nvidia_ncf
```

3. Start an interactive session in the NGC container to run preprocessing/training and inference.

The NCF PyTorch container can be launched with:
```bash
mkdir data
docker run --runtime=nvidia -it --rm --ipc=host  -v ${PWD}/data:/data nvidia_ncf bash
```

This will launch the container and mount the `./data` directory as a volume to the `/data` directory inside the container.
Any datasets and experiment results (logs, checkpoints etc.) saved to `/data` will be accessible
in the `./data` directory on the host.

4. Download and preprocess the data.

Preprocessing consists of downloading the data, filtering out users that have less than 20 ratings (by default), sorting the data and dropping the duplicates.
The preprocessed train and test data is then saved in PyTorch binary format to be loaded just before training.

>Note: Preprocessing requires PyTorch and should therefore be run inside the Docker container.

No data augmentation techniques are used.

To download and preprocess the ML-20m dataset you can run:

```bash
./prepare_dataset.sh
```

Note: This command will return immediately without downloading anything if the data is already present in the `/data` directory.

This will store the preprocessed training and evaluation data in the `./data` directory so that it can be later
used to train the model (by passing the appropriate `--data` argument to the `ncf.py` script).

5. Start training.

After the Docker container is launched, the training with the default hyperparameters can be started with:

```bash
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=8 --use_env ncf.py --data /data/cache/ml-20m --checkpoint_dir /data/checkpoints/
```

This will result in a checkpoint file being written to `/data/checkpoints/model.pth`.


6. Start validation/evaluation.

The trained model can be evaluated by passing the `--mode` test flag to the `run.sh` script:

```bash
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=1 --use_env ncf.py --data /data/cache/ml-20m  --mode test --load_checkpoint_path /data/checkpoints/model.pth
```


## Advanced

The following sections provide greater details of the dataset, running training and inference, and the training results.

### Scripts and sample code

The `ncf.py` script contains most of the training and validation logic. Data loading and preprocessing code is located in `dataloading.py`.
The model architecture is defined in `neumf.py`. Some initial data preprocessing is located in `convert.py`.
The logger directory contains simple bookkeeping utilities for storing training results.

### Command-line options

To see the full list of available options and their descriptions, use the `-h` or `--help` command line option, for example:
`python ncf.py --help`

The following example output is printed when running the sample:
```

```

### Getting the data

The NCF model was trained on the ML-20m dataset.
For each user, the interaction with the latest timestamp was included in the test set and the rest of the examples are used as the training data.

This repository contains the `./prepare_dataset.sh` script which will automatically download and preprocess the training and validation datasets.
By default, data will be downloaded to the `/data` directory. The preprocessed data will be placed in `/data/cache`.

#### Dataset guidelines

The required format of the data is a CSV file with three columns: `user_id`, `item_id` and `timestamp`. This CSV should contain only the positive examples,  in other words,
the ones for which an interaction between a user and an item occurred. The negatives will be sampled during the training and validation.

#### Multi-dataset

This implementation is tuned for the ML-20m and ML-1m datasets.
Using other datasets might require tuning some hyperparameters (for example, learning rate, beta1 and beta2).

If you'd like to use your custom dataset you can do it by adding support for it in the `prepare_dataset.sh` and `download_dataset.sh` scripts.

The performance of the model depends on the dataset size.
Generally, the model should scale better for datasets containing more data points.
For a smaller dataset you might experience slower performance.


#### ML-1m

To download, preprocess and train on the ML-1m dataset run:
```bash
./prepare_dataset.sh ml-1m
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=8 --use_env ncf.py --data /data/cache/ml-1m
```

### Training process
The name of the training script is `ncf.py`. Because of the multi-GPU support, it should always be run with the torch distributed launcher like this:
```bash
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=<number_of_gpus> --use_env ncf.py --data <path_to_dataset> [other_parameters]
```

The main result of the training are checkpoints stored by default in `/data/checkpoints/`. This location can be controlled
by the `--checkpoint_dir` command-line argument.

The validation metric is Hit Rate at 10 (HR@10) with 100 test negative samples. This means that for each positive sample in
the test set 100 negatives are sampled. All resulting 101 samples are then scored by the model. If the true positive sample is
among the 10 samples with highest scores we have a "hit" and the metric is equal to 1, otherwise it's equal to 0.
The HR@10 metric is the number of hits in the entire test set divided by the number of samples in the test set.  

### Inference process

Inference can be launched with the same script used for training by passing the `--mode test` flag:
```bash
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=<number_of_gpus> --use_env ncf.py  --data <path_to_dataset> --mode test [other_parameters]
```

The script will then:
* Load the checkpoint from the directory specified by the `--checkpoint_dir` directory
* Run inference on the test dataset
* Compute and print the validation metric

## Performance

### Benchmarking

#### Training performance benchmark

NCF training on NVIDIA DGX systems is very fast, therefore, in order to measure train and validation throughput, you can simply run the full training job with:
```bash
./prepare_dataset.sh
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=8 --use_env ncf.py --data /data/cache/ml-20m --epochs 5
```

At the end of the script, a line reporting the best train throughput is printed.


#### Inference performance benchmark

Validation throughput can be measured by running the full training job with:
```bash
./prepare_dataset.sh
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=8 --use_env ncf.py --data /data/cache/ml-20m --epochs 5
```

The best validation throughput is reported to the standard output.

### Known issues

#### Scaling beyond 8 GPUs
Neural Collaborative Filtering is a relatively lightweight model that trains quickly with this relatively smaller dataset, ML-20m.
Because of that, the high ratio of communication to computation makes it difficult to
efficiently use more than 8 GPUs. Typically, this is not an issue because when using 8
GPUs with FP16 precision, the training is sufficiently fast. However, if youâ€™d like to
 scale the training to 16 GPUs and beyond, you might try modifying the model so that
 the communication-computation ratio facilitates better scaling. This could be done, for example,
  by finding hyperparameters that enable using a larger batch size or by reducing the
  number of trainable parameters.

#### Memory usage

In the default settings, the additional memory beyond 16GB may not be fully utilized.
This is because we set the default batch size for ML-20m dataset to 1M,
which is too small to completely fill-up multiple 32GB GPUs.
1M is the batch size for which we experienced the best convergence on the ML-20m dataset.
However, on other datasets, even faster performance can be possible by finding hyperparameters that work well for larger batches and leverage additional GPU memory.
