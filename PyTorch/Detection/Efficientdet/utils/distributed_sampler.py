    """Sampler that restricts data loading to a subset of the dataset.
    It is especially useful in conjunction with
    :class:`torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel`. In such case, each

    and load a subset of the original dataset that is exclusive to it.

        num_replicas (optional): Number of processes participating in

        rank (optional): Rank of the current process within num_replicas.
