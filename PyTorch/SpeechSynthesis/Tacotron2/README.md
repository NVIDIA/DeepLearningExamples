# The model
This text-to-speech (TTS) system is a combination of two neural network models:
* a modified Tacotron 2 model from the [Natural TTS Synthesis by Conditioning WaveNet on Mel Spectrogram Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05884) paper and
* a flow-based neural network model from the [WaveGlow: A Flow-based Generative Network for Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00002) paper.

The Tacotron 2 and WaveGlow model form a text-to-speech system that enables
user to synthesise a natural sounding speech from raw transcripts without
any additional prosody information.

Our implementation of Tacotron 2 model differs from the model described in the
paper. Our implementation uses Dropout instead of Zoneout to regularize the LSTM layers.
Also, the original text-to-speech system proposed in the paper used the [WaveNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03499)
model to synthesize waveforms.
In our implementation, we use the WaveGlow model for this purpose.

Both models are based on implementations of NVIDIA GitHub repositories
[Tacotron 2](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2) and
[WaveGlow](https://github.com/NVIDIA/waveglow), and are trained on a publicly
available [LJ Speech dataset](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/).

This model trains with mixed precision tensor cores on Volta, therefore researchers
can get results much faster than training without tensor cores.  This model is
tested against each NGC monthly container release to ensure consistent accuracy
and performance over time.

## Default configuration
The Tacotron 2 model produces mel spectrograms from input text using
encoder-decoder architecture. WaveGlow is a flow-based model that consumes the
mel spectrograms to generate speech. Both models support multi-gpu and mixed
precision training with dynamic loss scaling (see Apex code [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex/blob/master/apex/fp16_utils/loss_scaler.py)),
as well as mixed precision inference.

# Setup
The following sections list the requirements in order to
start training the Tacotron 2 and WaveGlow models.

## Requirements
This repository contains `Dockerfile` which extends the PyTorch NGC container
and encapsulates some dependencies. Aside from these dependencies, ensure you
have the following components:

* [NVIDIA Docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)
* [PyTorch 19.05-py3 NGC container](https://ngc.nvidia.com/registry/nvidia-pytorch) or newer
* [NVIDIA Volta based GPU](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/volta-gpu-architecture/)


For more information about how to get started with NGC containers, see the
following sections from the NVIDIA GPU Cloud Documentation and the Deep Learning
Documentation:

* [Getting Started Using NVIDIA GPU Cloud](https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/ngc-getting-started-guide/index.html)
* [Accessing And Pulling From The NGC Container Registry](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/dgx/user-guide/index.html#accessing_registry)
* [Running PyTorch](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/dgx/pytorch-release-notes/running.html#running)

# Quick Start Guide
To train your model using mixed precision with tensor cores or using FP32,
perform the following steps using the default parameters of the Tacrotron 2
and WaveGlow model on the [LJ Speech](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/) dataset.

## 1. Clone the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples.git
cd DeepLearningExamples/PyTorch/SpeechSynthesis/Tacotron2
```

## 2. Download and preprocess the dataset.
Use the `./scripts/prepare-dataset.sh` download script to automatically
download and preprocess the training, validation and test datasets. To run this script, issue:
```bash
bash scripts/prepare-dataset.sh
```
Data is downloaded to the `./LJSpeech-1.1` directory (on the host).  The
`./LJSpeech-1.1` directory is mounted to the `/workspace/tacotron2/LJSpeech-1.1`
location in the NGC container.  The script will also generate the necessary
filelists for training and validation in `./filelists` if they are not already present.

## 3. Build the Tacotron 2 and WaveGlow PyTorch NGC container.
```bash
bash scripts/docker/build.sh
```

## 4. Start an interactive session in the NGC container to run training/inference.
After you build the container image, you can start an interactive CLI session with

```bash
bash scripts/docker/interactive.sh
```

The `interactive.sh` script requires that the location on the dataset is specified.
For example, `LJSpeech-1.1`.

## 5. Start training.
To run Tacotron 2 training, run:
```bash
bash scripts/train_tacotron2.sh
```

To run WaveGlow training, run:
```bash
bash scripts/train_waveglow.sh
```

## 6. Start validation/evaluation.
Ensure your loss values are comparable to those listed in the table in the 
Results section. For both models, the loss values are stored in the 
`./output/nvlog.json` log file. 

After you have trained the Tacotron 2 model for 1500 epochs and the 
WaveGlow model for 800 epochs, you should get audio results similar to the 
samples in the `./audio` folder. For details about generating audio, see the 
[Inference process](#inference-process) section below.

The training scripts automatically run the validation after each training 
epoch. The results from the validation are printed to the standard output 
(`stdout`) and saved to the log files.

## 7. Start inference.
After you have trained the Tacotron 2 and WaveGlow models, you can perform 
inference using the respective checkpoints that are passed as `--tacotron2` 
and `--waveglow` arguments. 

To run inference issue:
```bash
python inference.py --tacotron2 <Tacotron2_checkpoint> --waveglow <WaveGlow_checkpoint> -o output/ -i text.txt --fp16-run
```
The speech is generated from text file passed with `-i` argument. To run 
inference in mixed precision, use `--fp16-run` flag. The output audio will 
be stored in the path specified by `-o` argument.

# Details
The following sections provide greater details of the dataset, running training 
and inference, and the training results.

## Training process
The Tacotron2 and WaveGlow models are trained separately and independently. 
Both models obtain mel spectrograms from short time Fourier transform (STFT) 
during training. These mel spectrograms are used for loss computation in case 
of Tacotron 2 and as conditioning input to the network in case of WaveGlow.

The training loss is averaged over an entire training epoch, whereas the 
validation loss is averaged over the validation dataset. Performance is 
reported in total input tokens per second for the Tacotron 2 model, and 
in total output samples per second for the WaveGlow model. Both measures are 
recorded as `train_iter_items/sec` (after each iteration) and `train_epoch_items/sec` 
(averaged over epoch) in the output log. The result is averaged over an 
entire training epoch and summed over all GPUs that were included in the training.

Even though the training script uses all available GPUs, you can change 
this behavior by setting the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` variable in your 
environment or by setting the `NV_GPU` variable at the Docker container launch 
([see section "GPU isolation"](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/wiki/nvidia-docker#gpu-isolation)).

## Enabling mixed precision
[Mixed precision](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03740) training offers significant 
computational speedup by performing operations in half-precision format, while 
storing minimal information in single-precision to retain as much information as 
possible in critical parts of the network. Since the introduction of 
[tensor cores](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensor-cores) in the Volta and Turing 
architectures, significant training speedups are experienced by switching to 
mixed precision -- up to 3x overall speedup on the most arithmetically intense 
model architectures. Using [mixed precision training](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/mixed-precision-training/index.html) 
previously required two steps:

1. Porting the model to use the FP16 data type where appropriate.
2. Manually adding loss scaling to preserve small gradient values.
 

Mixed precision is enabled in PyTorch by using the Automatic Mixed Precision 
(AMP),  library from [APEX](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex) that casts variables 
to half-precision upon retrieval, while storing variables in single-precision 
format. Furthermore, to preserve small gradient magnitudes in backpropagation, 
a [loss scaling](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/mixed-precision-training/index.html#lossscaling) 
step must be included when applying gradients. In PyTorch, loss scaling can be 
easily applied by using `scale_loss()` method provided by AMP. The scaling value 
to be used can be [dynamic](https://nvidia.github.io/apex/fp16_utils.html#apex.fp16_utils.DynamicLossScaler) or fixed.

By default, the `train_tacotron2.sh` and `train_waveglow.sh` scripts will launch 
mixed precision training with tensor cores. You can change this behaviour by 
removing the `--fp16-run` flag from the `train.py` script.

For an in-depth walk through on AMP, check out sample usage [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex/tree/master/apex/amp#usage-and-getting-started). 
[APEX](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex) is a PyTorch extension that contains 
utility libraries, such as AMP, which require minimal network code changes to 
leverage tensor cores performance.

To enable mixed precision, you can:
* Import AMP from APEX, for example: 
    ```bash
    from apex import amp
    ```

* Initialize an AMP handle, for example: 
    ```bash
    amp_handle = amp.init(enabled=True, verbose=True)
    ```

* Wrap your optimizer with the AMP handle, for example:
    ```bash
    optimizer = amp_handle.wrap_optimizer(optimizer)    
    ```

* Scale loss before backpropagation (assuming loss is stored in a variable called losses)
    * Default backpropagate for FP32:
        ```bash
        losses.backward()
        ```
    
    * Scale loss and backpropagate with AMP:
        ```bash
        with optimizer.scale_loss(losses) as scaled_losses:
            scaled_losses.backward()
        ````

paper and [Training With Mixed Precision](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/mixed-precision-training/index.html) documentation.

## Inference process
You can run inference using the `./inference.py` script. This script takes text 
as input, and runs Tacotron 2 and then WaveGlow inference to produce an audio 
file. It requires  pre-trained checkpoints from Tacotron 2 and WaveGlow models 
and input text as a text file, with one phrase per line.

To run inference, issue:
```bash
python inference.py --tacotron2 <Tacotron2_checkpoint> --waveglow <WaveGlow_checkpoint> -o output/ -i text.txt --fp16-run
```
Here, `Tacotron2_checkpoint` and `WaveGlow_checkpoint` are pre-trained 
checkpoints for the respective models, and `text.txt` contains input phrases. 
Audio will be saved in the output folder.

You can find all available options by calling `python inference.py --help`.

# Benchmarking
The following section shows how to run benchmarks measuring the model 
performance in training mode.

## Inference performance benchmark
To benchmark the inference performance on a batch size=1, run:

* For FP32
    ```bash
    python inference.py --tacotron2 <Tacotron2_checkpoint> --waveglow <WaveGlow_checkpoint> -o output/ --include-warmup --log-file=output/nvlog_fp32.json
    ```
* For FP16
    ```bash
    python inference.py --tacotron2 <Tacotron2_checkpoint> --waveglow <WaveGlow_checkpoint> -o output/ --include-warmup --fp16-run --log-file=output/nvlog_fp16.json
    ```

The output log files will contain performance numbers for Tacotron 2 model
(number of input tokens per second, reported as `tacotron2_items_per_sec`)
and for WaveGlow (number of output samples per second, reported as
`waveglow_items_per_sec`). The `inference.py` script will run a few warmup
iterations before running the benchmark.

# Changelog
March 2019

* Initial release

# Known issues
For mixed precision training of Tacotron 2, dropouts on LSTMCells 
cause overflow leading to dynamic loss scaling going to 1, see [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2/issues/112). 
The current workaround, which is already applied in our model implementation, 
is to convert `attention_rnn` and `decoder_rnn` back to FP32 precision.
