    # from librosa 0.6
    Compute the sum-square envelope of a window function at a given hop length.

    This is used to estimate modulation effects induced by windowing
    observations in short-time fourier transforms.

    Parameters
    ----------
    window : string, tuple, number, callable, or list-like
        Window specification, as in `get_window`

    n_frames : int > 0
        The number of analysis frames

    hop_length : int > 0
        The number of samples to advance between frames

    win_length : [optional]
        The length of the window function.  By default, this matches `n_fft`.

    n_fft : int > 0
        The length of each analysis frame.

    dtype : np.dtype
        The data type of the output

    Returns
    -------
    wss : np.ndarray, shape=`(n_fft + hop_length * (n_frames - 1))`
        The sum-squared envelope of the window function
