  This is an implementation of the network structure surrounding a transformer
  encoder as described in "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers
  for Language Understanding" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805).

  The BertClassifier allows a user to pass in a transformer stack, and
  instantiates a classification network based on the passed `num_classes`
  argument.

  Attributes:
    network: A transformer network. This network should output a sequence output
      and a classification output. Furthermore, it should expose its embedding
      table via a "get_embedding_table" method.
    num_classes: Number of classes to predict from the classification network.
    initializer: The initializer (if any) to use in the classification networks.
      Defaults to a Glorot uniform initializer.
    output: The output style for this network. Can be either 'logits' or
      'predictions'.
