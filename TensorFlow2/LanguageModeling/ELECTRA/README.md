## Model overview
 
Electra (Efficiently Learning an Encoder that Classifies Token Replacements Accurately), is a novel pre-training method for language representations which outperforms existing techniques, given the same compute budget on a wide array of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. This model is based on the [ELECTRA: Pre-training Text Encoders as Discriminators Rather Than Generators](https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1xMH1BtvB) paper. NVIDIA's implementation of ELECTRA is an optimized version of the [Hugging Face implementation](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/electra.html), leveraging mixed precision arithmetic and Tensor Cores on Volta, Turing, and the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architectures for faster training times with state-of-the-art accuracy.
 
This repository contains the scripts to interactively launch data download, training, benchmarking and inference routines in a Docker container for pre-training on your own dataset (Wikipedia and BookCorpus shown as an example), and fine-tuning for tasks such as question answering. The major differences between the original implementation as described in the paper and this version of ELECTRA are as follows:
 
-   Scripts to download Wikipedia and BookCorpus datasets
-   Scripts to preprocess downloaded data or a custom corpus into inputs and targets for pre-training in a modular fashion
-   Automatic mixed precision (AMP) support and optimized for performance
-   Multi-GPU and Multi-node training support with push-button scripts to reach state-of-the-art accuracy and performance.
 
Other publicly available implementations of Electra include:
1. [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/electra.html)
2. [Google's implementation](https://github.com/google-research/electra)
 
This model is trained with mixed precision using Tensor Cores on Volta, Turing, and the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architectures. Additionally, this model provides push-button solutions to pre-training, fine-tuning and inference and on a corpus of choice. As a result, researchers can get results up to 4x faster than training without Tensor Cores. This model is tested against each NGC monthly container release to ensure consistent accuracy and performance over time.
 
### Model architecture
 
ELECTRA is a combination of two Transformer models: a generator and a discriminator. The generator’s role is to replace tokens in a sequence, and is therefore trained as a masked language model. The discriminator, which is the model we are interested in, tries to identify which tokens were replaced by the generator in the sequence. Both generator and discriminator use the same architecture as the encoder of the Transformer. The encoder is simply a stack of Transformer blocks, which consist of a multi-head attention layer followed by successive stages of feed-forward networks and layer normalization. The multi-head attention layer performs self-attention on multiple input representations.

### Default configuration
 
ELECTRA uses a new pre-training task called replaced token detection (RTD), that trains a bidirectional model (like a MLM) while learning from all input positions (like a LM). Inspired by generative adversarial networks (GANs), instead of corrupting the input by replacing tokens with “[MASK]” as in BERT, the generator is trained to corrupt the input by replacing some input tokens with incorrect, but somewhat plausible, fakes. On the other hand, the discriminator is trained to distinguish between “real” and “fake” input data. 
 
The [Google ELECTRA repository](https://github.com/google-research/electra) reports the results for three configurations of ELECTRA, each corresponding to a unique model size. This implementation provides the same configurations by default, which are described in the table below.
 
| **Model** | **Hidden layers** | **Hidden unit size** | **Parameters** |
|:---------:|:----------:|:---:|:----:|
|ELECTRA_SMALL|12 encoder| 256 | 14M|
|ELECTRA_BASE |12 encoder| 768 |110M|
|ELECTRA_LARGE|24 encoder|1024 |335M|

### Feature support matrix
 
The following features are supported by this model.
 
| **Feature** | **ELECTRA** |
|:---------:|:----------:|
|LAMB|Yes|
|Automatic mixed precision (AMP)|Yes|
|XLA|Yes|
|Horovod Multi-GPU|Yes|
|Multi-node|Yes|
   
#### Features
 
**Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP)**
 
This implementation of ELECTRA uses AMP to implement mixed precision training. It allows us to use FP16 training with FP32 master weights by modifying just a few lines of code.
 
**Horovod**
 
Horovod is a distributed training framework for TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and MXNet. The goal of Horovod is to make distributed deep learning fast and easy to use. For more information about how to get started with Horovod, see the [Horovod: Official repository](https://github.com/horovod/horovod).
 
Multi-GPU training with Horovod
 
Our model uses Horovod to implement efficient multi-GPU training with NCCL. For details, see example sources in this repository or see the [TensorFlow tutorial](https://github.com/horovod/horovod/#usage).
 
**XLA support (experimental)**
 
XLA is a domain-specific compiler for linear algebra that can accelerate TensorFlow models with potentially no source code changes. The results are improvements in speed and memory usage: most internal benchmarks run ~1.1-1.5x faster after XLA is enabled. 
[AMP](https://nvidia.github.io/apex/amp.html) is an abbreviation used for automatic mixed precision training.
 
**Multi-node Training**
 
Supported on a Pyxis/Enroot Slurm cluster.
 
### Mixed precision training
 
Mixed precision is the combined use of different numerical precisions in a computational method. [Mixed precision](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03740) training offers significant computational speedup by performing operations in half-precision format, while storing minimal information in single-precision to retain as much information as possible in critical parts of the network. Since the introduction of [Tensor Cores](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensor-cores) in Volta, and following with both the Turing and Ampere architectures, significant training speedups are experienced by switching to mixed precision -- up to 3x overall speedup on the most arithmetically intense model architectures. Using mixed precision training requires two steps:
 
1.  Porting the model to use the FP16 data type where appropriate.
2.  Adding loss scaling to preserve small gradient values.
 
This can now be achieved using Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) for TensorFlow to enable the full [mixed precision methodology](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/mixed-precision-training/index.html#tensorflow) in your existing TensorFlow model code. AMP enables mixed precision training on Volta, Turing, and NVIDIA Ampere GPU architectures automatically. The TensorFlow framework code makes all necessary model changes internally.
 
In TF-AMP, the computational graph is optimized to use as few casts as necessary and maximize the use of FP16, and the loss scaling is automatically applied inside of supported optimizers. AMP can be configured to work with the existing tf.contrib loss scaling manager by disabling the AMP scaling with a single environment variable to perform only the automatic mixed-precision optimization. It accomplishes this by automatically rewriting all computation graphs with the necessary operations to enable mixed precision training and automatic loss scaling.

-   Techniques used for mixed precision training, see the [Mixed-Precision Training of Deep Neural Networks](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/mixed-precision-training-deep-neural-networks/) blog.

#### Enabling mixed precision
 
This implementation exploits the TensorFlow Automatic Mixed Precision feature. To enable AMP, you simply need to supply the `--amp` flag to the `run_pretraining.py` or `run_tf_squad.py` script. For reference, enabling AMP required us to apply the following changes to the code:
 
1. Set the Keras mixed precision policy:
   ```python
   if config.amp:
       policy = tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.Policy("mixed_float16", loss_scale="dynamic")
       tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.set_policy(policy)
   ```
 
2. Use the loss scaling wrapper on the optimizer:
   ```python
   if config.amp:
        optimizer = tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer(optimizer, "dynamic")
   ```
 
3. Use scaled loss to calculate the gradients:
   ```python
   #Scale loss
   if config.amp:
       total_loss = optimizer.get_scaled_loss(total_loss)
   gradients = tape.gradient(total_loss, model.trainable_variables)
   #Get unscaled gradients if AMP
   if config.amp:
       gradients = optimizer.get_unscaled_gradients(gradients)
   ```
 
#### Enabling TF32
 
TensorFloat-32 (TF32) is the new math mode in [NVIDIA A100](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/) GPUs for handling the matrix math also called tensor operations. TF32 running on Tensor Cores in A100 GPUs can provide up to 10x speedups compared to single-precision floating-point math (FP32) on Volta GPUs. 
 
TF32 Tensor Cores can speed up networks using FP32, typically with no loss of accuracy. It is more robust than FP16 for models which require high dynamic range for weights or activations.
 
For more information, refer to the [TensorFloat-32 in the A100 GPU Accelerates AI Training, HPC up to 20x](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/) blog post.
 
TF32 is supported in the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture and is enabled by default.

More information on how to set up and launch can be found in the [Multi-node Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/multi-node-bert-user-guide).
 
## Quick Start Guide
 
To train your model using mixed precision or TF32 precision with Tensor Cores or using FP32, perform the following steps using the default parameters of the ELECTRA model. The default parameters for pre-training have been set to run on both 8x A100 40G and 8 x V100 32G GPUs. For the specifics concerning training and inference, see the [Advanced](#advanced) section.
 
1. Clone the repository.
 
```
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples.git
cd DeepLearningExamples/TensorFlow2/LanguageModeling/ELECTRA
```
 
2. Build ELECTRA on top of the NGC container.
```
bash scripts/docker/build.sh
```
 
3. Start an interactive session in the NGC container to run data download, training and inference.
```
bash scripts/docker/launch.sh
```
 
Resultant logs of pre-training and fine-tuning routines are stored in the `results/` folder. Checkpoints are stored in the `results/<model-name>/` folder.
 
Required data is downloaded into the `data/` directory by default.
 
4. Download and preprocess the dataset.
 
This repository provides scripts to download, verify, and extract the following datasets:
 
-   [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) (fine-tuning for question answering)
-   Wikipedia (pre-training)
-   BookCorpus (pre-training)
 
To download, verify, extract the datasets, and create the shards in `tfrecord` format, run:
```
/workspace/electra/data/create_datasets_from_start.sh
```
 
Note: For fine-tuning only, Wikipedia and Bookscorpus dataset download and preprocessing can be skipped by commenting it out.
 
- Download Wikipedia only for pretraining
 
The pre-training dataset is 170GB+ and takes 15+ hours to download. The BookCorpus server most of the time gets overloaded and also contains broken links resulting in HTTP 403 and 503 errors. Hence, it is recommended to skip downloading BookCorpus data by running:
 
```
/workspace/electra/data/create_datasets_from_start.sh wiki_only
```
 
- Download Wikipedia and BookCorpus
 
Users are welcome to download the BookCorpus from other sources to match our accuracy, or repeatedly try our script until the required number of files are downloaded by running the following:
```
/workspace/electra/data/create_datasets_from_start.sh wiki_books
```
 
Note: Not using the BookCorpus can potentially change the final accuracy on a few downstream tasks.
 
5. Start pretraining.
 
To run on a single node 8 x V100 32G, from within the container, you can use the following script to run pre-training.
```
bash scripts/run_pretraining.sh
```
 
The default hyperparameters are set to run on both 8 x A100 40G and 8 x V100 32G.
 
For the other platforms, the configs present in `scripts/configs/pretrain_config.sh` can be used as shown below:
```
bash scripts/run_pretraining.sh $(source scripts/configs/pretrain_config.sh && dgxa100_8gpu_amp)
```
 
To run pre-training on multiple nodes, see the [Multi-node](#multi-node) section.
 
6. Postprocess pretrained checkpoint and fine-tune on SQuAD dataset
 
The above pretrained ELECTRA model representations can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer for a state-of-the-art question answering system. Running the following script extracts and saves the discriminator and generator from the pretrained checkpoint and fine-tunes the discriminator on SQuAD:
 
```
checkpoints=results/base/checkpoints bash scripts/finetune_ckpts_on_squad.sh
```
 
It internally runs `postprocess_pretrained_ckpt.py` which extracts and saves the discriminator and the generator from the pretrained checkpoint.
 
The default hyperparameters are set to run on 8 x V100 16G.
 
To run fine-tuning with the SQuAD dataset on Google's pretrained checkpoints, do the following.
```
bash scripts/run_squad.sh
```
 
For other platforms, configs present in `scripts/configs/squad_config.sh` can be used as shown below:
```
bash scripts/run_squad.sh $(source scripts/configs/squad_config.sh && dgxa100_8gpu_amp) train_eval
```
 
7. Start validation/evaluation.
 
Validation can be performed by running:
```
bash scripts/run_squad.sh $(source scripts/configs/squad_config.sh && dgxa100_8gpu_amp) eval
```
Running training first is required to generate needed checkpoints.
 
8. Start inference/predictions.
 
Inference can be performed by running:
```
bash scripts/run_squad.sh $(source scripts/configs/squad_config.sh && dgxa100_8gpu_amp) prediction
```
Inference predictions are saved to `<OUTPUT_DIRECTORY>/predictions.json`.

### Command-line options
 
To see the full list of available options and their descriptions, use the `-h` or `--help` command line option, for example:
 
`python run_pretraining.py --help`
 
`python run_tf_squad.py --help`
 
Detailed descriptions of command-line options can be found in the [Parameters](#parameters) section.
 
### Getting the data
 
For pre-training ELECTRA, we use the concatenation of Wikipedia (2500M words) as well as BookCorpus (800M words). For Wikipedia, we extract only the text passages and ignore headers, lists, and tables. ELECTRA requires that datasets are structured as a document level corpus rather than a shuffled sentence level corpus because it is critical to extract long contiguous sentences.
 
The preparation of the pre-training dataset is described in the `dataPrep.py` script found in the `data/` folder. The component steps in the automated scripts to prepare the datasets are as follows:
 
1.  Data download and extract - the dataset is downloaded and extracted.
 
2.  Clean and format - document tags, etc. are removed from the dataset.
 
3.  Sentence segmentation - the corpus text file is processed into separate sentences.
 
4.  Sharding - the sentence segmented corpus file is split into a number of uniformly distributed smaller text documents.
 
5.  `tfrecord` file creation - each text file shard is processed by the `build_pretraining_dataset.py` script to produce a corresponding `tfrecord` file. The script generates input data for the input text shard.
 
The tools used for preparing the BookCorpus and Wikipedia datasets can be applied to prepare an arbitrary corpus. The `create_datasets_from_start.sh` script in the `data/` directory applies sentence segmentation, sharding, and `tfrecord` file creation given an arbitrary text file containing a document-separated text corpus.
 
For fine-tuning a pre-trained ELECTRA model for specific tasks, by default this repository prepares the following dataset:
 
-   [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/): for question answering
 
Depending on the speed of your internet connection, this process takes about a day to complete. The BookCorpus server could sometimes get overloaded and also contain broken links resulting in HTTP 403 and 503 errors. You can either skip the missing files or retry downloading at a later time.
 
 
#### Multi-dataset
 
This repository provides functionality to combine multiple datasets into a single dataset for pre-training on a diverse text corpus at the shard level. Currently Wikipedia and BookCorpus get merged in `data/create_datasets_from_start.sh`. Snippets to download and format more text corpuses can be added to `data/dataPrep.py`. The sharding scheme combines multiple corpuses together and splits them into the required number of training(90%) and testing(10%) shards. Once the data is sharded, the `build_pretraining_dataset.py` converts raw text shards to tokenized segments and saves the dataset to the `data` directory in TFRecord format. This dataset can now be used to pre-train ELECTRA.
 
 
### Training process
 
The training process consists of two steps: pre-training and fine-tuning.
 
#### Pre-training
 
Pre-training is performed using `run_pretraining.py` along with parameters defined in `scripts/run_pretraining.sh` and `scripts/configs/pretrain_configs.sh`.
 
The `run_pretraining.sh` script runs a job on a single node that trains the ELECTRA-base model from scratch using Wikipedia and BookCorpus datasets as training data using the LAMB optimizer.
 
Phase 1: (Maximum sequence length of 128)
-   Runs on 8 GPUs with training batch size of 176 per GPU
-   Uses a learning rate of 6e-3
-   Has FP16 precision enabled
-   Runs for 10000 steps, where the first 2000 are warm-up steps
-   Saves a checkpoint every 500 iterations (keeps only the latest 5 checkpoints) and at the end of training. All checkpoints, and training logs are saved to the `results/<model_name>` directory.
-   Creates a log file containing all the output
 
Phase 2: (Maximum sequence length of 512)
-   Runs on 8 GPUs with training batch size of 24 per GPU
-   Uses a learning rate of 4e-3
-   Has FP16 precision enabled
-   Runs for 930 steps, where the first 200 are warm-up steps
-   Saves a checkpoint every 500 iterations (keeps only the latest 5 checkpoints) and at the end of training. All checkpoints, and training logs are saved to the `results/<model_name>` directory.
-   Creates a log file containing all the output
 
Specific configs available at `scripts/configs/pretrain_config.sh` can be run as follows:
```
bash scripts/run_pretraining.sh $(source scripts/configs/pretrain_config.sh && dgxa100_8gpu_amp)
bash scripts/run_pretraining.sh $(source scripts/configs/pretrain_config.sh && dgx2_16gpu_amp)
bash scripts/run_pretraining.sh $(source scripts/configs/pretrain_config.sh && dgx1_8gpu_amp)
```
 
The above commands will train ELECTRA based on Wikipedia and BookCorpus to state-of-the-art accuracy on any DGX platform using FP16 arithmetic. Around 96% of the training sequences are of length 128 (phase 1 of training) and less than 4% of the training sequences are of length 512 (phase 2 of training).
 
In order to run pre-training routine on an initial checkpoint, perform the following in `scripts/run_pretraining.sh`:
-   set `restore_checkpoint=<path_to_checkpoint>`
-   Note: The parameter value assigned to `--model_size` during training should remain unchanged. Also, to resume pre-training on your corpus of choice, the training dataset should be created using the same vocabulary file used in `data/create_datasets_from_start.sh`.
 
 
#### Multi-node
 
Multi-node runs can be launched on a Pyxis/enroot Slurm cluster (see [Requirements](#requirements)) with the `run.sub` script with the following command for a 48-node NVIDIA DGX A100 example for both phase 1 and phase 2:
 
```
BATCHSIZE=176 LR=6e-3 GRAD_ACCUM_STEPS=1 PHASE=1 STEPS=10000 WARMUP=2000 b1=0.878 b2=0.974 decay=0.5 skip_adaptive=yes end_lr=0.0 sbatch N48 --ntasks-per-node=8 run.sub
BATCHSIZE=24 LR=4e-3 GRAD_ACCUM_STEPS=3 PHASE=2 STEPS=930 WARMUP=200 b1=0.878 b2=0.974 decay=0.5 skip_adaptive=yes end_lr=0.0 sbatch N48 --ntasks-per-node=8 run.sub
```
 
Checkpoint after phase 1 will be saved in `<results_dir>/models/<model_name>`. The checkpoint will be automatically picked up to resume training on phase 2. Note that phase 2 should be run after phase 1.
 
The batch variables `BATCHSIZE`, `LR`, `GRAD_ACCUM_STEPS`, `PHASE`, `STEPS`, `WARMUP`, `b1`, `b2`, `decay`, `skip_adaptive` and `end_lr` refer to the Python arguments `train_batch_size`, `learning_rate`, `gradient_accumulation_steps`, `phase2`, `num_train_steps`, `num_warmup_steps`, `opt_beta_1`, `opt_beta_2`, `lr_decay_power`, `skip_adaptive` and `end_lr` in `run_pretraining.py` respectively.
 
Note that the `run.sub` script is a starting point that has to be adapted depending on the environment. In particular, variables such as `docker_image` and `datadir` handle the location of the files for each phase.
 
Refer to the files contents to see the full list of variables to adjust for your system.
 
 
#### Fine-tuning
 
Fine-tuning is provided for a variety of tasks. The following tasks are included with this repository through the following scripts:
 
-   Question Answering (`scripts/run_squad.sh`)
 
By default, each Python script implements fine-tuning a pre-trained ELECTRA model for a specified number of training epochs as well as evaluation of the fine-tuned model. Each shell script invokes the associated Python script with the following default parameters:
 
-   Uses 8 GPUs
-   Has FP16 precision enabled
-   Has XLA enabled
-   Saves a checkpoint at the end of training to the `checkpoints/` folder
 
Specific configs available at `scripts/configs/squad_configs.sh` can be run as follows:
```
bash scripts/run_squad.sh $(source scripts/configs/squad_config.sh && dgxa100_8gpu_amp) train_eval
bash scripts/run_squad.sh $(source scripts/configs/squad_config.sh && dgx2_16gpu_amp) train_eval
bash scripts/run_squad.sh $(source scripts/configs/squad_config.sh && dgx1_8gpu_amp) train_eval
```
 
Fine-tuning Python scripts implement support for mixed precision and multi-GPU training through [Horovod](https://github.com/horovod/horovod). For a full list of parameters and associated explanations, see the [Parameters](#parameters) section.
 
All fine-tuning shell scripts have the same positional arguments, outlined below:
 
```bash scripts/run_squad.sh <pretrained electra model> <epochs> <batch size> <learning rate> <amp|fp32> <num_gpus> <seed> <SQuAD version> <path to SQuAD dataset> <results directory> <checkpoint_to_load> <mode (either `train`, `eval` or `train_eval`)>```
 
By default, the mode positional argument is set to `train_eval`. See the [Fine-tuning parameters](#fine-tuning-parameters) for explanations of each positional argument.
 
Note: The first positional argument (the path to the checkpoint to load) is required.
 
Each fine-tuning script assumes that the corresponding dataset files exist in the `data/` directory or separate path can be a command-line input to `run_squad.sh`.
 
### Inference process
 
#### Fine-tuning inference
 
Evaluation fine-tuning is enabled by the same scripts as training:
 
-   Question Answering (`scripts/run_squad.sh`)
 
The mode positional argument of the shell script is used to run in evaluation mode. The fine-tuned ELECTRA model will be run on the evaluation dataset, and the evaluation loss and accuracy will be displayed.
 
Each inference shell script expects dataset files to exist in the same locations as the corresponding training scripts. The inference scripts can be run with default settings. By setting the `mode` variable in the script to either `eval` or `prediction` flag, you can choose between running predictions and evaluating them on a given dataset or just the former.
 
`bash scripts/run_squad.sh <pretrained electra model> <epochs> <batch size> <learning rate> <amp|fp32> <num_gpus> <seed> <SQuAD version> <path to SQuAD dataset> <results directory> <path to fine-tuned model checkpoint> <eval or prediction>`
 
To run inference interactively on question-context pairs, use the script `run_inference.py` as follows:
 
`python run_inference.py --electra_model <electra_model_type> --init_checkpoint <fine_tuned_checkpoint>  --question="What food does Harry like?" --context="My name is Harry and I grew up in Canada. I love apples."`
 
 
## Performance
 
### Benchmarking
 
The following section shows how to run benchmarks measuring the model performance in training and inference modes.
 
#### Training performance benchmark
 
Training performance benchmarks for both pre-training phases can be obtained by running `scripts/benchmark_pretraining.sh`. Default parameters are set to run a few training steps for a converging NVIDIA DGX A100 system.
 
To benchmark training performance with other parameters, run:
```
bash scripts/benchmark_pretraining.sh <train_batch_size_p1> <amp|tf32|fp32> <xla|no_xla> <num_gpus> <accumulate_gradients=true|false> <gradient_accumulation_steps_p1> <train_batch_size_p2> <gradient_accumulation_steps_p2> <base> 
```
 
An example call used to generate throughput numbers:
```
bash scripts/benchmark_pretraining.sh 88 amp xla 8 true 2 12 4 base
```
 
Training performance benchmarks for fine-tuning can be obtained by running `scripts/benchmark_squad.sh`. The required parameters can be passed through the command-line as described in [Training process](#training-process). The performance information is printed after 200 training iterations.
 
To benchmark the training performance on a specific batch size, run:
```
bash scripts/benchmark_squad.sh train <num_gpus> <batch size> <infer_batch_size> <amp|tf32|fp32> <SQuAD version> <path to SQuAD dataset> <results directory> <checkpoint_to_load> <cache_Dir>
```
 
An example call used to generate throughput numbers:
```
bash scripts/benchmark_squad.sh train 8 16
```
 
#### Inference performance benchmark
 
Inference performance benchmarks fine-tuning can be obtained by running `scripts/benchmark_squad.sh`. The required parameters can be passed through the command-line as described in [Inference process](#inference-process). This script runs one epoch by default on the SQuAD v1.1 dataset and extracts the average performance for the given configuration. 
 
To benchmark the training performance on a specific batch size, run:
`bash scripts/benchmark_squad.sh train <num_gpus> <batch size> <infer_batch_size> <amp|fp32> <SQuAD version> <path to SQuAD dataset> <results directory> <checkpoint_to_load> <cache_Dir>`

In the above table, FP32 and TF32 runs were made at half the batch per GPU and twice the gradient accumulation steps of a run with mixed precision in order to not run out of memory.
 
 
The SQuAD fine-tuning scripts by default train on [Google's ELECTRA++ base pretrained checkpoint](https://github.com/google-research/electra#released-models) which uses around 10x training dataset (dataset used by XLNet authors) and greater than 5x training steps compared to the training recipe in `scripts/run_pretraining.sh`. The latter trains and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on Wikipedia and BookCorpus datasets only.
