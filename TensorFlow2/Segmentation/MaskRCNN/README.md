## Model overview

Mask R-CNN is a convolution-based neural network for the task of object instance segmentation. The paper describing the model can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870). NVIDIAâ€™s Mask R-CNN 20.06 is an optimized version of [Google's TPU implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/tree/master/models/official/mask_rcnn), leveraging mixed precision arithmetic using Tensor Cores on NVIDIA Volta, Turing, and Ampere GPUs while maintaining target accuracy. 

This model is trained with mixed precision using Tensor Cores on Volta, Turing, and the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architectures. Therefore, researchers can get results  2.2x faster than training without Tensor Cores, while experiencing the benefits of mixed precision training. This model is tested against each NGC monthly container release to ensure consistent accuracy and performance over time.

This repository also contains scripts to interactively launch training, 
benchmarking and inference routines in a Docker container.

The major differences between the official implementation of the paper and our version of Mask R-CNN are as follows:

- Mixed precision support with [TensorFlow AMP](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/tensorflow-user-guide/index.html#tfamp).
- Gradient accumulation to simulate larger batches.
- Custom fused CUDA kernels for faster computations.

There are other publicly NVIDIA available implementations of Mask R-CNN:

- [NVIDIA PyTorch implementation](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/PyTorch/Segmentation/MaskRCNN)
- [Matterport](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN)
- [Tensorpack](https://github.com/tensorpack/tensorpack/tree/master/examples/FasterRCNN)

### Model architecture

Mask R-CNN builds on top of Faster R-CNN adding an additional mask head for the task of image segmentation.

The architecture consists of the following:

- ResNet-50 backbone with Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)
- Region proposal network (RPN) head
- RoI Align
- Bounding and classification box head
- Mask head

### Default configuration

The Mask R-CNN configuration and the hyper-parameters for training and testing purposes are in separate files.
The default configuration of this model can be found at `mask-rcnn/hyperparameters/mask_rcnn_params.py`. 

The default configuration is as follows:

  - Feature extractor:
    - Images resized with aspect ratio maintained and smaller side length between [832,1344]
    - Ground Truth mask size 112
    - Backbone network weights are frozen after second epoch

  - RPN:
    - Anchor stride set to 16
    - Anchor sizes set to (32, 64, 128, 256, 512)
    - Foreground IOU Threshold set to 0.7, Background IOU Threshold set to 0.3
    - RPN target fraction of positive proposals set to 0.5
    - Train Pre-NMS Top proposals set to 2000 per FPN layer
    - Train Post-NMS Top proposals set to 1000
    - Test Pre-NMS Top proposals set to 1000 per FPN layer
    - Test Post-NMS Top proposals set to 1000
    - RPN NMS Threshold set to 0.7

  - RoI heads:
    - Foreground threshold set to 0.5
    - Batch size per image set to 512
    - Positive fraction of batch set to 0.25

The default hyper-parameters can be found at `mask-rcnn/hyperparameters/cmdline_utils.py`. 
These hyperparameters can be overridden through the command-line options, in the launch scripts.

### Feature support matrix

The following features are supported by this model:

| **Feature** | **Mask R-CNN** |
-------------|---------------------|
| Automatic mixed precision (AMP) | Yes |
| Horovod Multi-GPU (NCCL)        | Yes |
| Accelerated Linear Algebra (XLA)| Yes |     

#### Features

**Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP)**
 
This implementation of Mask-RCNN uses AMP to implement mixed precision training. It allows us to use FP16 training with FP32 master weights by modifying just a few lines of code.
 
**Horovod**
 
Horovod is a distributed training framework for TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and MXNet. The goal of Horovod is to make distributed deep learning fast and easy to use. For more information about how to get started with Horovod, see the [Horovod: Official repository](https://github.com/horovod/horovod).
 
Multi-GPU training with Horovod
 
Our model uses Horovod to implement efficient multi-GPU training with NCCL. For details, see example sources in this repository or see the [TensorFlow tutorial](https://github.com/horovod/horovod/#usage).
 
**XLA support (experimental)**
 
XLA is a domain-specific compiler for linear algebra that can accelerate TensorFlow models with potentially no source code changes. The results are improvements in speed and memory usage: most internal benchmarks run ~1.1-1.5x faster after XLA is enabled.

### Mixed precision training

Mixed precision is the combined use of different numerical precisions in a computational method. [Mixed precision](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03740) training offers significant computational speedup by performing operations in half-precision format while storing minimal information in single-precision to retain as much information as possible in critical parts of the network. Since the introduction of [Tensor Cores](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensor-cores) in the Volta and Turing architecture, significant training speedups are experienced by switching to mixed precision -- up to 3x overall speedup on the most arithmetically intense model architectures. Using [mixed precision training](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/mixed-precision-training/index.html) previously required two steps:
1.  Porting the model to use the FP16 data type where appropriate.    
2.  Adding loss scaling to preserve small gradient values.

This can now be achieved using Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) for TensorFlow to enable the full [mixed precision methodology](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/mixed-precision-training/index.html#tensorflow) in your existing TensorFlow model code.  AMP enables mixed precision training on Volta and Turing GPUs automatically. The TensorFlow framework code makes all necessary model changes internally.

In TF-AMP, the computational graph is optimized to use as few casts as necessary and maximize the use of FP16, and the loss scaling is automatically applied inside of supported optimizers. AMP can be configured to work with the existing tf.contrib loss scaling manager by disabling the AMP scaling with a single environment variable to perform only the automatic mixed-precision optimization. It accomplishes this by automatically rewriting all computation graphs with the necessary operations to enable mixed precision training and automatic loss scaling.

-   How to train using mixed precision, see the [Mixed Precision Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03740) paper and [Training With Mixed Precision](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/mixed-precision-training/index.html) documentation.
-   Techniques used for mixed precision training, see the [Mixed-Precision Training of Deep Neural Networks](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/mixed-precision-training-deep-neural-networks/) blog.
-   How to access and enable AMP for TensorFlow, see [Using TF-AMP](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/dgx/tensorflow-user-guide/index.html#tfamp) from the TensorFlow User Guide.

#### Enabling mixed precision

Mixed precision is enabled in TensorFlow by using the Automatic Mixed Precision (TF-AMP) extension which casts variables to half-precision upon retrieval, while storing variables in single-precision format. Furthermore, to preserve small gradient magnitudes in backpropagation, a [loss scaling](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/mixed-precision-training/index.html#lossscaling) step must be included when applying gradients. In TensorFlow, loss scaling can be applied statically by using simple multiplication of loss by a constant value or automatically, by TF-AMP. Automatic mixed precision makes all the adjustments internally in TensorFlow, providing two benefits over manual operations. First, programmers need not modify network model code, reducing development and maintenance effort. Second, using AMP maintains forward and backward compatibility with all the APIs for defining and running TensorFlow models.

#### Enabling TF32

TensorFloat-32 (TF32) is the new math mode in [NVIDIA A100](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/) GPUs for handling the matrix math also called tensor operations. TF32 running on Tensor Cores in A100 GPUs can provide up to 10x speedups compared to single-precision floating-point math (FP32) on Volta GPUs. 

TF32 Tensor Cores can speed up networks using FP32, typically with no loss of accuracy. It is more robust than FP16 for models which require high dynamic range for weights or activations.

For more information, refer to the [TensorFloat-32 in the A100 GPU Accelerates AI Training, HPC up to 20x](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/) blog post.

TF32 is supported in the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture and is enabled by default.

## Quick Start Guide

To train your model using mixed precision with Tensor Cores or using 32-bit, perform the following steps using 
the default parameters of the Mask R-CNN model on the COCO 2014 dataset.

1. Clone the repository.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples.git
    cd DeepLearningExamples/TensorFlow/Segmentation/MaskRCNN
    ```

2.  Build the Mask R-CNN TensorFlow NGC container.

    **For TensorFlow 1.1x:** `bash ./scripts/docker/build_tf1.sh`

    **For TensorFlow 2.x:** `bash ./scripts/docker/build_tf2.sh`

3.  Start an interactive session in the NGC container to run training/inference.

    Run the following command to launch the Docker container, the only argument is the *absolute path* to the 
    `data directory` which holds or will hold the `tfrecords` data. If data has not already been downloaded in the `data directory` then download it in step 4, else step 4 can be skipped.
    
    **For TensorFlow 1.1x:** `bash ./scripts/docker/launch_tf1.sh [data directory]`    
    
    **For TensorFlow 2.x:** `bash ./scripts/docker/launch_tf2.sh [data directory]`

4.  Download and preprocess the dataset.

    This repository provides scripts to download and extract the [COCO 2017 dataset](http://cocodataset.org/#download).  
    If you already have the data then you do not need to run the following script, proceed to downloading the pre-trained weights. 
    Data will be downloaded to the `data directory` provided in step 3.
    
    ```bash
    cd dataset
    bash download_and_preprocess_coco.sh /data
    ```

    By default, the data is organized into the following structure:

    ```bash
    <data/dir>
    annotations/
      instances_train2017.json
      instances_val2017.json
    train2017/
      COCO_train2017_*.jpg
    val2017/
      COCO_val2017_*.jpg
    ```

    This repository also provides scripts to download the pre-trained weights of ResNet-50 backbone. 
    The script will make a new directory with the name `weights` in the current directory and 
    download the pre-trained weights in it.

    ```bash
    ./download_and_process_pretrained_weights.sh
    ```

    Ensure that the `weights` folder created has a `resnet` folder in it. Inside the `resnet` folder there 
    should be 3 folders for checkpoints and weights: `extracted_from_maskrcnn`, `resnet-nhwc-2018-02-07` and 
    `resnet-nhwc-2018-10-14`. Before moving to the next step, ensure the above folders are not empty.


5. Start training.
    
    To run training for a default configuration (on 1/4/8 GPUs, AMP/32-bit), run one of the scripts in the 
    `./scripts` directory called `./scripts/train{_AMP}_{1,4,8}GPU.sh`. For example: 
    
    `bash ./scripts/train_AMP_8GPU.sh`

    The above script trains a model and performs an evaluation on the COCO 2017 dataset. By default, this training script:

    -  Uses 8 GPUs.
    -  Saves a checkpoint every 3696 iterations and at the end of training. All checkpoints, evaluation results and training logs are saved to the `/results` directory (in the container which can be mounted to a local directory).
    -  Mixed precision training with Tensor Cores.

6. Start validation/evaluation.

    - For evaluation with AMP precision: `bash ./scripts/evaluation_AMP.sh`
    - For evaluation with 32-bit precision: `bash ./scripts/evaluation.sh`
