/**
 * \brief BlockReduceRaking provides raking-based methods of parallel reduction across a CUDA thread block.  Supports non-commutative reduction operators.
 *
 * Supports non-commutative binary reduction operators.  Unlike commutative
 * reduction operators (e.g., addition), the application of a non-commutative
 * reduction operator (e.g, string concatenation) across a sequence of inputs must
 * honor the relative ordering of items and partial reductions when applying the
 * reduction operator.
 *
 * Compared to the implementation of BlockReduceRaking (which does not support
 * non-commutative operators), this implementation requires a few extra
 * rounds of inter-thread communication.
